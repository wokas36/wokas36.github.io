<div style="text-align: justify">We invite researchers working on topics such as predictive modelling of biological function and properties, generative and simulation-based approaches, adaptive experimental design, data integration, and other emerging areas to join this vibrant exchange on shaping the next generation of AI-enabled biological discovery.

# Call for Papers 

<div style="text-align: justify">We welcome extended abstracts (2-4 pages, non-archival), including works-in-progress and preliminary results. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Prediction of biomolecular structures, properties, complexes, and interactions
* Generative models for biological sequences and structures
* Bayesian optimization and active learning for guided biological experimentation
* Geometric and symmetry-aware deep learning for molecular representations
* Interpretable and uncertainty-aware models for biological design
* Multi-modal learning over sequence, structure, and functional data
* Benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation protocols for biological design tasks
* Foundation models for biology
* Novel applications of AI in computational and experimental biology
* Position papers and/or posters addressing fundamental challenges or limitations of AI in computational and experimental biology

<div style="text-align: justify">Accepted submissions will be presented posters, with a select few being chosen as short spotlight talks, and will be made available on the workshop website. This is a non-archival workshop, allowing authors to publish full versions of their work at future venues.

<!-- We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)). In many country, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs.**


### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
